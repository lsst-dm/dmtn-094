LSP Authentication
==================

Introduction
============

This document covers core technologies and interactions between services, APIs, and applications
interacting with the LSST Science Platform. The authentication use cases covered in this cover
interactive users who are primarily interacting with the LSP in the following ways:

-  Logged into the notebook aspect
-  Logged into the portal aspect
-  From a local terminal, exercising the API aspect from third party libraries or applications

For the users in question, we make a few assumptions about use of the LSP in this context:

-  Users include LSST staff, and scientists that are members of science collaborations.
-  Users already have an NCSA account through some mechanism. If they wish use federated
   credentials, the assumption is that their federated credentials have been associated with their
   NCSA account.
-  Users are active, continuously or intermittently, over the course of an extended work day.
   Interactions will typically last several hours, though the system should be prepared for
   interactions lasting up to 24 hours.
-  At the start of an interaction with the LSP system, users do not know which types of data they
   will access. Users do know which services they will access.

Basic Concepts
==============

We define users and groups within this document, as well as minimal requirements from the IAM system
as needed by the LSP, and likely the broader Data Management System. It's expected further
definition of the IAM system will be available in the future in a change controlled document.

User
----

A user is minimally identified by either a UNIX ID number (UID) and a user name. A service MUST be
able to lookup a UID if it has a user name, or a user name if it has a UID.

Real Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A user account identifying a specific person is a *real account*. All LSST users in the US and
Chilean DACs have an LSST account. An LSST account is also the same account as an NCSA UNIX account.

Shared Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A user account might actually be a *shared account*, which does not identify a specific person. A
shared account must have at least one real account managing the shared account.

A shared account is nominally for the use and organization resources shared across real users, such
as disk storage, database tables, and compute, if available.

Shared Account Use Cases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The primary use case of a shared account is for quota management attributing to a group. It also
provides a logical namespace to which users can manage resources like database tables.

A shared account might be created for a few *limited* use cases. This might include:

-  Science Collaborations
-  Data Releases
-  Projects; such as Stack Club
-  Teams; such as Alerts, DAX, SQuaRE

Groups
------

A user is a member of one or more groups. All groups defined for a given user are owned exclusively
by that user. All groups a user creates MUST follow the `group naming
conventions <https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/LAAIM/LSST+IAM+Group+Naming+Convention>`__
outlined by the LSST Chief Security Officer. A core set of groups do not belong to a specific user.
These are defined and managed by the LSST system administrators.

The IAM system SHOULD disallow group names that are not representable as UNIX group names or
database role names within the Data Management System. This implies a 32 character limit, as limited
by Red Hat Linux.

   Before Oracle 12.2, there's a limit of 30 characters on role names.

All users MUST be a member and the only member of a user-private group. The group name should be the
name of the user. This follows the Red Hat feature called `User Private
Groups <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system_administrators_guide/ch-managing_users_and_groups#s2-users-groups-private-groups>`__.

Some systems, to which Groups may be synced to, may not allow assignment of permissions directly to
users, only groups. If this is the case, then a user can assign permissions to the user private
group. This would enable another user to extend access to a resource by assigning a read permission
to the user's group, for example.

Group membership MUST be discoverable through at least an LDAP service provided by the IAM system.
Additional services for querying group membership MAY be implemented.

User and Groups Synchronization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When necessary, the IAM system SHOULD create users and groups in underlying systems; sychronizing
membership accordingly. The sychronization SHOULD finish in under an hour, and MUST finish within 24
hours.

In databases, groups should be represented as roles.

The assignment of privleges on resources according to users and groups is out of scope for this
document.

Caching Group Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clients querying a group membership service SHOULD cache results. Results SHOULD be cached with a
TTL for no less than 30 seconds and no longer than 1 hour. A 5 minute TTL is recommended.

Users and services should be made aware of the caching TTL as well as potential latencies due to
`user and groups synchronization <#user-and-groups-synchronization>`__. It may take up to 2 hours
for groups to be synchronized and caches invalidated.

If group information is encoded in a token, users MUST be informed to destroy the token through some
form of logout mechanism. Single Logout is out of scope for this document.

Privacy and File Sharing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This section is informational

Through the use of sticky bits, umasks, and user-private groups, it will be possible to build a
system that can both preserve privacy, by setting sticky bits on user-private directories for the
user's user-private group, as well as preserve access on directories that are intended to be shared,
such as those owned by a Science Collaboration.

Roles
-----

   This section is informational

There's currently no concept of roles in the existing IAM system for NCSA. A system that represents
roles must also have permissions associated with roles. As such, Roles and are generally out of
scope for this document, but they are mentioned for informational purposes.

It's possible that roles may be implemented group membership. For example, the portal web
application may rely on have the groups ``lsst_int_portal_usdac_user``,
``lsst_int_portal_pdac_user``, and ``lsst_int_portal_admin`` defined. In this example, these groups
are effectively roles. The portal application can

Authentication
--------------

Authentication in LSST is the act of associating a user with their LSST account.

Authentication by a `real user <#real-accounts>`__ is handled by the IAM system. All authentication
for LSP services are handled through the OAuth 2.0 Protocol by the IAM system. Normally this will be
through the OpenID Connect layer.

Authentication for a `shared account <#shared-accounts>`__ is out of scope for this document. It is
expected that users may be members of groups that are owned by shared accounts, but they will always
authenticate as themselves.

Authentication using means such as kerberos is out of scope of this document.

.. _identitylsstorg---account-management:

identity.lsst.org - Account Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All accounts can be managed through `identity.lsst.org <https://identity.lsst.org>`__. This will
include profile information about the user, as well as group management. Users may need to interact
with an LSST administrator in order to be granted the ability to create groups. This can be done by
emailing ``lsst-account _at_ ncsa.illinois.edu`` (and CC ``lsst-sysadmins _at_ lsst.org``).

Federated Identity and LSST Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to improve security and convenience for users, users may associate eligible accounts with
their LSST account, enabling them to delegate to third parties authenticators. This associaton is
called `Federated Identity <https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/LAAIM/Federated+Identity>`__,
which allows you to authenticate to LSST services using the associated accounts.
`CILogon <#cilogon>`__ is used to determine eligible authenticators for federated identity; the list
typically includes accounts from the `InCommon federation <#incommon-federation>`__, as well as
OAuth accounts from services such as Google and Github. Association of accounts from third party
authenticators to the user's LSST account is configured through the
`identity.lsst.org <https://identity.lsst.org>`__ account management portal. Once an account is
associated, a user can login using credentials and authentication services from their associated
accounts.

After a successful federated authentication from the associated account, the CILogon service MUST
produce the equivalent authentication information to that of a successful authentication of an LSST
account.

Authorization
-------------

Authorization in LSST helps determine what acts a user may perform in a given system.

Service Access Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LSP services MAY limit access by users at the service level. The IAM system MUST return `service
access capabilities <#capabilities-based-authorization>`__ in the form of claims in tokens for
services.

In these cases, a service needs to acquire a list of groups associated with a user, either as claims
in a token, or through a membership query to a service.

   See Also: `Data and Service Classifications <#data-and-service-classifications>`__

Data Access Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Low-Level systems SHOULD be relied upon to authorize access to data. This includes:

-  Disk Storage, such as NFS, GPFS;
-  Databases, such as Oracle or Qserv

Capabilities-based Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This section is informational

We expect some form of capabilities-based authorization will be useful for the Data Management
System in the future. This section is an overview of capabilities-based authorization and
requirements to implement such a system.

Capabilties-based security system is based on the `object-capability security
model <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model>`__.

A capabilities-based system, in the context of LSST DM system, would rely on:

1. A definition of resources across the LSST DM system to which you can assign access rights to;
   such as dataset collections (butler repos), database tables, services.
2. A reference to a resource or set of resources; such as a token, which the system can validate and
   enforce access control
3. A definition of operations to be performed on the resource; such as ``read``, ``write``, and
   ``execute``, for example.

Together, the reference and operation can be included in a message and will represent a capability.
In order for the system to be secure, the message MUST be unforgeable. This is implemented through a
cryptographic signature.

For the issuance of the capabilities, the following are required:

-  A method of determining the set of those capabilities for a given user or use case; and
-  A system which either implements that method, which issues the unforgeable message (a token or
   certificate); or
-  A system that is notified notified by another system implementing the method;

.. _authorization-1:

Authorization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Low-level systems, including disk storage (NFS, GPFS, S3/Swift/Ceph) and databases (Oracle, MySQL),
do not have a way of enforcing capabilities-based authorizations. As such, to integrate a security
system with capabilities, it's required to have a service in front of those systems which can
process the messages.

To process a request with a capabilities message, a service MUST:

1. Agree to the definiton of resources issued in the message, mapping them to the system the system
   (or underlying system) manages
2. Agree to the definition of operations in the message; mapping them to the operations the system
   (or underlying system) implements
3. Examine the request and verify ALL resource and operation pairs a request may need are
   represented in the message.

For the LSP, we have not finished defining the resources of the message, though we expect those
resources correspond loosely to services; we expect operations will be either ``read`` or ``write``
in the context of LSP; and we expect a service will largely perform control accesss to that service,
and, transitively, the data served by that service. The resources, operations, and services
currently identified are in the `data and service
classifications <#data-and-service-classifications>`__ section below.

Data and Service Classifications
--------------------------------

   This section is informational

..

   This section is subject to change

These classifications are loosely based on LPM-122 classifications, LDM-542, and LSE-163. Work is
being performed to clarify the classifications of data and services together.

Technologies
============

This section will cover some technologies used by both the IAM system and the LSP system to meet the
goals of the LSP system.

-  `InCommon <#incommon-federation>`__ and eduPerson to verify attributesabout scientists, when
   possible;
-  `CILogon <#cilogon>`__ to federate those identities and implement return identity data about
   users in the form of *claims*.
-  `OAuth 2.0 <#oauth-2.0>`__ as the generic protocol to interface with CILogon. OpenID Connect is
   layered over the OAuth 2.0 protocol to required for an authentication implementation.
-  `JWT <#jwt>`__ as the implementation for identity tokens. This is also required as a result of
   using OpenID Connect.

InCommon Federation
-------------------

InCommon is an identity federation in the United States that provides a common framework for
identity management and trust across member institutions. The InCommon Federation's identity
management is built on top of eduPerson attributes. The interface used to interact with the
federated institutions is Shibboleth.

.. _oauth-20:

OAuth 2.0
---------

OAuth2 is a framework that enables users to authorize applications to retrieve information, either
in the form of a token or through the use of a token, about the user from an identity provider. An
identity provider may be Google, Github or an institution. Typically, institutions themselves do not
implement OAuth 2.0 interfaces, but do implement interfaces with Shibboleth and SAML.

OAuth 2.0 specifies how you may ask for information about a user. It also specifies a method,
through tokens, which a service may use to request and validate information about the user.

.. _passing-oauth-20-tokens:

Passing OAuth 2.0 Tokens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

According to the OAuth 2.0 protocol, all tokens are transferred via the Authorization Header:

   ``Authorization: Bearer [TOKEN]``

This is the default, standard, and recommended way of passing *ALL* OAuth 2.0 tokens, whether it's
an OpenID Connect Identity token or a SciToken.

In some cases, existing clients of LSP services may exist that may not allow a user to send an
arbitrary authorization header, or would need code to do so. It's expected such a client may be
configured to either provide an interface for `HTTP Basic
Authorization <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617>`__, or a user may manually populate a username
and password into the URL.

For compatibilty with such systems, some services in the LSP, most importantly the WebDAV service,
MAY accept tokens in the Authorization header according to HTTP Basic scheme, where the token is the
username and the password is ``x-oauth-basic``, or empty.

   See Also: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617#section-2

For clients which do not allow specifying a username and a password directly, additional
compatiblity may be possible by manually constructing the URL with the token in it:

   ``https://<token>:x-oath-basic@lsp.lsst.org/api``

..

   Note: Care should be taken to always make the URL https.

OpenID Connect - Identity Tokens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenID Connect is an simple authentication layer on top of OAuth2. OpenID Connect specifies a small
set of information about a user which may be used to authenticate a user using claims implemented
according to the OAuth2 specification.

OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Typically, a service, such as Firefly, operates as an OAuth2 client to a service - the resource
server. Due to implementation details of OAuth, you typically need a client ID and a client secret
in order to register a client to receive information from the OAuth service (CILogon in our case).
This works fine when the client is under full administrative control, like Firefly, but it falls
apart if you want to deploy a client to a user-controlled device, such as a desktop or mobile phone.
In those scenarios, you should generate per-deployment client IDs and secrets.

OAuth has a provision for that called Dynamic Client Registration.

In the cases of TOPCAT, Astroquery, or PyVO - it may be beneficial to model either an application
(TOPCAT) or the device itself as a client, should CILogon to support Dynamic Client Registration.
This would allow TOPCAT or any application on the system to work similarly to a Mobile Application
on a phone.

CILogon
-------

CILogon is a generic authentication proxy/clearing house for authentication providers from multiple
services or institutions, especially institutions federated into the InCommon federation, as well as
other services such as Github and Google. CILogon serves as a common endpoint for these various
identity providers and translates their authentication mechanisms (OAuth 2.0, Shibboleth, OpenID
Connect) mechanisms to a common authentication mechanism, often while also translating claims, when
possible.

CILogon translates authentication information and user claims into OpenID Connect claims, layered on
the OAuth 2.0 protocol. Using this, we typically know what institution a user is from, their email
address, and whether or not they are faculty, staff, or a student. We may use this information to
also map them to an NCSA user, provided that information has been previously captured, and
potentially retrieve additional claims about that user, such as the `groups <#groups>`__ they are a
member of. Should we want additional claims beyond the subject of a token - claims such as group
membership or capabilities, we will need to deploy a server which we can present a refresh token to
that will provide us with those additional claims. We do not expect this implementation-specific
needs to be included in CILogon.

JWT
---

A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a way of representing claims to as JSON, as well as information for
validating those claims through the use of signatures (JWS) in the token, and a meants of validating
those signature (JWE/JWK) - all in the same token. Included in the JWT specification is also a way
of encoding a token using Base64 in a way that's friendly for the web.

For all LSST Applications, we will use RS256, an asymmetric algorithm, to sign the tokens.

We will be relying primarily on tokens generated by CILogon. In certain cases, the services MAY
issue tokens that should be honored by other services. The primary use case of this is to ensure a
request is completed by the system.

A whitelist of token issuers we trust MUST be maintained, and services that validate tokens MUST be
configurable with that whitelist. Public keys used to validate tokens must be available on all token
issuers, follwing to the JWK specification. Applications should cache the JWK for a given token
issuer for at least 5 minutes and not more than 1 hour.

All Access Tokens will be based on JWT. Some access tokens may also include claims implemented
according to the SciTokens specification.

See also: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519

SciTokens
---------

SciTokens is an implementation of `capabilities-based
authorizations <#capabilities-based-authorization>`__ built as specific claims inside a JWT token.
Those claims are modeled as lists of capabilities; organized as colon-separated pairs of operations;
such as ``read``, ``write``, or ``execute``, with arbitrary named resources. A named resource may be
a file path (e.g. ``read:/datasets/catalogs``) or a more general resource (e.g.
``read:mysql://server:3806/schema``)

SciTokens recommends not using the subject (``sub`` claim) for identity purposes. This implies that
SciTokens should not be used for authorizations based on identity.

It's expected that we will use some form of login flow from CILogon to eventually translate claims a
client may have to a SciTokens token. It's expected that there will be a service where a user would
present tokens acquired from CILogon to the SciTokens service to acquire a refresh token and an
access token, with a very limited lifetime, from a SciTokens service. The refresh token may be used
to acquire new access tokens to present to services which will accept them. Services or applications
which frequently may need to operate on behalf of a user for longer than the lifetime of an access
token must acquire a refresh token, which they can use to acquire access tokens.

SciTokenss MUST be passed using one of the allowable methods defined for `passing OAuth 2.0
Tokens <#passing-oauth-2.0-tokens>`__.

Token lifetimes
===============

Access token lifetimes are expected to be short, typically on the order of several hours or less,
but may last as long as 24 hours, depending on the issuer and use case. An exact number is not
available.

Refresh tokens, which are used to acquire access tokens in the OAuth 2.0 protocol, can last longer.
It's expected a refresh token will last at least 24 hours and may last as long as a week. In some
limited use cases, they may last longer.

DAX services intend to guarantee all requests received that a DAX services recieved will succeed. To
work with shorter access token lifetimes, the succeed. In order to guarantee this, the DAX services
MUST issue a new token with the same claims which ONLY other DAX services will be configured to
honor. The lifetime of this token is not specified, but it should the upper bound for the limit of
time it takes to service a request, around 24 hours.

DAX services SHOULD NOT issue new tokens from requests with DAX-issued tokens.

Token Claims
============

Access tokens used for identity-based authorizations, issued from the appropriate token issuers,
MUST have the UID, user name, or fully qualified user name (email address) in the ``sub`` claim of
an access token. This will allow a service to identify the `user <#user>`__.

SciTokens Token Claims
----------------------

A SciToken MUST come with a ``scope`` claim. The ``scope`` claim is a space-seperated list of
capabilities. This is defined in `RFC6749 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.3>`__.

In accordance with the principle of least-privilege, a SciTokens issuer SHOULD also allow a user to
attenuate or remove those capabilites with successive calls to the SciTokens issuer, trading an
existing token for attenuated one. This may be especially useful with Grid computing, for example.
It's important to consider the lifetime of a token in these scenarios to determine what token may be
required.

Interactions
============

All of the following interactions have an assumption that a user is registered and is already a
member of requisite LDAP groups for accessing LSST resources within NCSA.

All of the following interactions als assume that a user using federated authentication has also
associated their account from a third parting Identity Provider to their account at NCSA, and that
CILogon is able to perform that association and return information about who the user is at NCSA.

It is also assumed that the Portal and Notebook applications have registered as OpenID Connect
clients to CILogon.

Portal Aspect (Firefly)
-----------------------

When a user first logs into the portal, they will be redirected to the token issuer. They may select
either NCSA as their Identity Provider or their home institution. CILogon executes the login,
ultimately returning information about who the user is at NCSA to the portal aspect through
CILogon's OpenID Connect interface and the token's ``sub`` claim. This provides the Portal aspect
with an access token and a refresh token.

Firefly is an OAuth 2.0 client and SHOULD use the refresh token to generate new access tokens. When
calls are made to DAX, the access token is passed as an OAuth 2.0 Bearer token in the HTTP
``Authorization`` header, according to the OAuth 2.0 Specification:

   ``Authorization: Bearer [TOKEN]``

Portal to DAX
-------------

The Portal will send the access token to a DAX service. The Portal SHOULD configure an HTTP client
with an authentication filter that can check the expiration of the access token, and, if necessary,
use the refresh token to acquire a new access token from the token issuer before issuing a request
to the DAX services.

Notebook Aspect
---------------

The Portal and the notebook should share some common session information about the user, including
refresh tokens, to enable smooth transitions and interoperability between the two. How this is
implemented is undefined.

Once a user is logged in to the Notebook access, a user in the Notebook aspect can be viewed as a
special case of Third Party access where we have some access to the user's local environment, so we
may be able to bootstrap an authentication mechanism on behalf of the user which ensures any
necessary tokens are implicitly available in the user's environment. For software developed by the
LSST that may utilize the DAX services, such as the Butler, we will ensure those applications can be
automatically configured based on some form of information in the user's Notebook environment. Other
third party software MAY be automatically configured, or they should be configurable in the same way
as if a user was running on their local machine and not in an LSP instance.

Astroquery/PyVO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are targeting Astroquery an PyVO as primary libraries to be used within the Notebook environment.

DAX
---

Authentication to DAX services is performed by using access tokens only. Applications calling into
DAX services are responsible for ensuring an access token is valid and hasn't expired before calling
into a DAX service.

A DAX service SHOULD reissue a new token if the service needs to issue a request to another DAX
service, as laid out in the `token lifetimes <#token-lifetimes>`__ section. If Qserv can accept
tokens directly, the token SHOULD be passed as the username.

We expect a PAM module to be a product of the IAM system which can accept an access token and login
a user.

VOSpace/WebDAV
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In general, users must use access tokens to interoperate with these services. We anticipate VOSpace
may possibly be implemented over FTS3.

Due to the management of file transfers in a service like FTS3 being potentially managed in a
batch-like system, we may need access tokens to live for 24 hours or more. It may also be necessary
to have a mechanism to force acquisition of a new access token before a file transfer request is
submitted.

Third Party
-----------

We expect there to be an explicit flow a user must engage in for all third party authentication.
It's not clear if a user of third-party applications will share a common token (e.g. Refresh Token)
or if a user will need to explicitly retrieve tokens for all third party services. At least in the
case of TOPCAT, we are incentivized to make the process as easy as possible, and we will work with
the TOPCAT developer closely to develop an optimal solution.

In the case of X.509 certifications, for applications such as GSI-SSH, a certificate is typically
written out to a well-defined location in the system's temporary disk space (e.g.
``/tmp/x509up_u${UID}``), ``.globus`` for Windows users) for reuse by all GSI-enabled applications.
A similar convention would need to be constructed to allow multiple third party applications to
share a common set of credential, or we can stash a token in an environment variable.

TOPCAT
~~~~~~

We will work closely with TOPCAT developers to find an optimal solution. It's possible that TOPCAT
is ideally modeled as mobile application which acquires a refresh token and manages the access token
locally.

.. _astroquerypyvo-1:

Astroquery/PyVO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the case of Astroquery, PyVO, or other third party applications, we expect a user to either
explicitly log-in or acquire a token from an LSST token UI and programmatically configure their
clients.
